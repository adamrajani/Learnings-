Take a look at all my learnings through my time in learning how to code.

National Immunization Data:
- In these files I have analysed a few areas of the National Immunization Survey for children and determined answers to questions such as the type of education for children's mothers, the avergae amount fo influenza doses for children that were breastfed compared to not breastfed, and the ratio of male/female children that got chicken pox comapred to did not get.
- This python file focuses on learning to use pandas
